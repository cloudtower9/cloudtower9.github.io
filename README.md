# METU-PHIL-NOTES
## Personal notes of a student, shared for the benefit of others, does not come with a guarantee of accuracy.
I haven't taken notes for all courses, but given the nature of some, notes are trivial, for others, they provide a good basis of study (for exams).

I wouldn't recommend these for the improvement of ones philosophical abilities -as some courses do not take the whole picture into account-, but for general study and to recall the topics discussed.
